Frendly CMS

My hobby project for creating more user friendly CMS content editor for end users who will 
edit their own web page. 

Demo can be found [here](http://lukasemolic.si/frendly/).

Tools and framework using in this projects are:

- jQuery
- Twitter Boostrap
- CKEditor (inline editor)


As you see I have just started to work on this project.
